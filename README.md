> As deep learning becomes increasingly entrenched in our lives, it's no

> diagnosis is a hot topic. In this project, we aim to explore how baseline

> Vision Transformer), and novel model architectures (Kolmogorov-Arnold 
> Networks) stack up against diagnosing lumbar conditions via radiology imagery.
